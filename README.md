# Workshop on "Applications for artificial intelligence (AI) in risk assessment" (AIRA)

## This repo contains the materials for the training course "Applications for artificial intelligence (AI) in risk assessment", held on Friday 25 November 2022 in Sitges - Barcelona in Spain.

## Disclaimer and credits
The repo is an adapted fork from [The TAME Toolkit for Introductory Data Science, Chemical-Biological Analyses, Predictive Modeling, and Database Mining for Environmental Health Research](https://github.com/UNCSRP/Data-Analysis-Training-Modules). Materials were selected and adapted from this resource, with permission from the authors.

## Course contents

 1. Chapter 1: An introduction to R
 2. Chapter 2: An introduction to the tidymodels framwork for R
 3. Chapter 3: Example of a Read-Across approach, using classical and ChemBERT - Transformer structural embeddings
 4. Chapter 4: A machine learning example for compound classification

MC: 

- Create ChemBERT embeddings from data lesson 2.6
- upload dataset into ./data
- upload Jupyter notebook into ./py
- find one example compound from the data, that overlaps with ASPIS compounds, present graph on slide

MT: 

- Create `bookdown` project for workshop, include the chembert-features as a new model.
- Tidymodels implementation (?)
- publish on RSConnect
- Clean up repo, add readme and credits and licence
- add dependencies in DECSCRIPTION file
